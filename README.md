# PWM_ZYNQ_SoC
In this project, we implement a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) controller on a PYNQ-Z1 board from Xilinx. We design a custom PWM IP with IP Integrator, insert the IP alongside a Zynq processing system, and implement a software in C that updates the value of the duty cycle. The image below illustrates the components of the SoC design.
